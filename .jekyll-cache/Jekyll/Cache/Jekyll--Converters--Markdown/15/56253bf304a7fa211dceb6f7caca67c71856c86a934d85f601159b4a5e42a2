I"Ž<h1 id="about-me">About Me</h1>

<p>I am a physics student at the Johns Hopkins University. I currently do work with the <a href="https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/">Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS)</a>. In the past I was heavily involved in the development of <a href="https://fathom.network/">Fathom</a> (back when it was still known as OTLW). I am also an avid proponent of free software and privacy.</p>
