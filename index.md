# About Me

I am a physics student at the Johns Hopkins University. I currently do work with the [Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS)](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/). In the past I was heavily involved in the development of [Fathom](https://fathom.network/) (back when it was still known as OTLW). I am also an avid proponent of free software and privacy. 

If you want to know more about me and my work feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/lordskh), my [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6519-502X), or my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf).
